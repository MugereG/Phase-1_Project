# Phase-1_Project


# Project Title: Phase 1 Independent Project

# Project Description:
I will design a Single Page Application (SPA). This application will be built using HTML/CSS/JS frontend which will in turn access data from an API. The entire application will be on a single page and will contain one HTML file. Event listners will be incorporated that will allow interactivity. 


# Project Set-up
This web-based application will list several free games that can be played online. A link to access the games will be provided to the user as well as other details associated with the game including, a short description, the developer, and the release date.
